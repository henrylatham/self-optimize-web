For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries;</p> <p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries; and</p> <p>Where we use service providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.

Any emails that we send will come from an email address ending in ‘@[insert company email domain here e.g. @example.com]’.</p> <p>“Sensitive” information</p> <p>Scribe does not seek to collect “sensitive” Personal Information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Scribe does not wish to receive any such data and will not request it.

This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p> <p>You will need to have created an account in order for us to provide you with your information because without an account, we are not able to connect your data to a verifiable email address. </p><p>From 25 May 2018, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number</p> of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<p></p> <p>Changes to your Personal Information and unsubscribing from the Service</p> <p>It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current.

If Scribe makes changes to the Privacy Policy, the new version will be posted on the Service. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy we will notify you by email.
