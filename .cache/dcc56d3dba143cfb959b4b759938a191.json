When content is shared in this way a link to that content is sent out via the relevant social media channel.\n\n  </p><p>When you share Personal Information through the Service with third parties (including other Subscribers) and via other online services (such as Facebook), that information will remain under the control of the third party or other service in question. Scribe has no control over the use of Personal Information which has been shared with third parties and this Privacy Policy Statement does not relate to such use of the Subscriber’s Personal Information. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of third parties to whom you share Personal Information with via the App.</p>\n\n  <p>Please be responsible with personal information of others when using Service.

Personal Information, or “personally identifiable information”, as it is sometimes known, is a reference to data that can be linked to or identified with a living individual.</p>\n\n  <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any data insofar as it is held, processed, disclosed or published in a form which cannot be linked to a living individual (such as anonymised data, aggregated data, or coded data which, in a given form, cannot effectively be used to extract Personal Information) (“Generic Data”). Scribe reserves the right to generate Generic Data out of any databases containing Personal Information and to make such use as it sees fit of any such Generic Data.</p>\n\n  <p>Personal Information we may collect about you</p>\n\n  <p>We will collect any information that you provide to us when you:</p>\n\n  <p>are making an enquiry, provide feedback or make a complaint on the App;</p>\n  <p>submit correspondence to us by post, email or via our website or App;</p>\n  <p>write on the App itself;</p>\n  <p>create an account to use the App;</p>\n  <p>update your profile and other account details;</p>\n  <p>subscribe to our newsletter and mailing lists;</p>\n  <p>fill in a form, conduct a search, post content on the App, respond to surveys, participate in promotions or use any other features of the App;</p>\n  <p>submit reviews and comments on the App; and/or</p>\n  <p>submit an application to a job vacancy.</p>\n  <p>The information you provide to us will include (depending on the circumstances):</p>\n\n  <p>Identity and contact data: title, names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers;</p>\n  <p>Account profile data: if you’re registering for an account you may also provide a username, password, language preferences;</p>\n  <p>Financial Data: if you are using the App to subscribe to the service, you will also provide payment details, which may include billing addresses, credit/debit card details and bank account details;</p>\n  <p>Employment and background data: if you are submitting a job application, you may also provide additional information about your academic and work history, projects and research that you are involved in, references and any other such similar information that you may provide us; and</p>\n  <p>Survey data: from time to time we might ask if you would be willing to participate in our surveys; if you agree, we will also collect information provided in such survey.</p>\n\n  <p>Written content on the App will be collected but encrypted for complete privacy by our App.</p>\n  <p>No-one will ever read a post created on the App.</p>\n\n  <p>We also collect the following information about you when you use the Service:</p>\n\n  <p>Location Data:  the Service accesses your location via the GPS ability of your Smartphone or other device for the purpose of locating convenient services, products and venues;</p>\n  <p>Google Analytics: the Service uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.

Our legitimate interests don’t automatically override yours and we won’t use your information if we believe your interests should override ours unless we have other grounds to do so (such as your consent or a legal obligation). If you have any concerns about our processing please refer to details of “Your Rights to your Personal Information”</p>\n\n  <p>Scribe uses Personal Information provided by Subscribers and accessed by the Service for the purposes of:</p>\n\n  <p>Providing access to our Service: administering, delivering, improving and personalising the Service (on the basis of our legitimate interest to ensure our website is presented in an effective and optimal manner).</p>\n  <p>Subscriber support and relationship management: to provide customer service and support (on the basis of our contract with you) and to manage our relationship with you, which will including notifying you about changes to our terms of use or privacy policy, and asking you to leave a review or take a survey (on the basis of performing our contract with you, to comply with our legal obligations and on the basis of our legitimate interests to keep our records updated and study how our website and services are used);</p>\n  <p>Prize draws, competitions and surveys:  to enable you to take part in prize draws, competitions and surveys (on the basis of performing our contract with you and our legitimate interest in studying how our website and services are used, to develop them and grow our business);</p>\n  <p>Marketing: to keep in contact with you about our news, events, new website features products or services that we believe may interest you, provided that we have the requisite permission to do so (either on the basis of your consent where we have requested it, or our legitimate interests to provide you with marketing communications where we may lawfully do so);</p>\n  <p>Advertising: to deliver relevant website content and advertisements to you and measure or understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you (on the basis of our legitimate interests in studying how our website/services are used, to develop them, to grow our business and to inform our marketing strategy);</p>\n  <p>Recruitment: to process any job applications you submit to us including sharing this with our third party recruitment agency;</p>\n  <p>Research: to carry out aggregated and anonymised research about general engagement with our website (on the basis of our legitimate interest in providing the right kinds of products and services to our website users);

The third party in question may also transmit back to Scribe any new information obtained from you.</p>\n\n  <p>Scribe will fully co-operate with law enforcement, investigation and security agencies and regulators to identify anyone who uses the Service or software for illegal activities. Scribe reserves the right to report to law enforcement, investigation and security agencies and to regulators any activities that are believed to be unlawful.</p>\n\n  <p>Storage  (including international transfers outside of the EEA), Security and Retention of Personal Information</p>\n\n\n  <p>Storage</p>\n\n  <p>Personal Information that Scribe collects is stored on its servers (which may be cloud-based and located outside the EEA).  We implement and maintain adequate security measures to protect such information stored on our servers and seek to comply with all local rules in respect of storage of data.</p>\n\n  <p>Whenever we transfer Personal Information  out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following transfer solutions are implemented:</p>\n\n  <p>We will only transfer your Personal Information  to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information  by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries;</p>\n  <p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries; and</p>\n  <p>Where we use service providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>\n  <p>Please contact us using the contact details at the top of this Privacy Notice if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>\n\n\n  <p>Security</p>\n\n  <p>We use appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect your information against any unauthorised access or unlawful use such as:</p>\n\n  <p>ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption;</p>\n  <p>maintaining a data protection policy for, and delivering data protection training to, our employees; and</p>\n  <p>limiting access to your personal information to those in our company who need to use it in the course of their work.</p>\n\n  <p>Retention</p>\n\n  <p>Dojo also strives to collect no more Personal Information from end-users than is required for the purpose for which it is collected. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it.</p>\n\n  <p>You can also play a part in keeping your information safe by:</p>\n\n  <p>choosing a strong account password and changing it regularly;</p>\n  <p>using different passwords for different online accounts;</p>\n  <p>keeping your booking references and passwords confidential and avoiding sharing your login with others;</p>\n  <p>making sure you log out of the Service each time you have finished using it. This is particularly important when using shared devices;</p>\n  <p>letting us know if you know or suspect that your account has been compromised, or if someone has accessed your account without your permission;</p>\n  <p>keeping your devices protected by using the latest version of your operating system and maintaining any necessary anti-virus software; and</p>\n  <p>being vigilant to any fraudulent emails that may appear to be from us. Any emails that we send will come from an email address ending in ‘@[insert company email domain here e.g. @example.com]’.</p>\n\n  <p>“Sensitive” information</p>\n\n  <p>Scribe does not seek to collect “sensitive” Personal Information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).  Scribe does not wish to receive any such data and will not request it. If Subscribers voluntarily post such information on the Service or share it with other Subscribers, the Subscriber</p> assumes the risk of such information being accessed, used or distributed by others as such information has been manifestly made public by the Subscriber.<p></p>\n\n  <p>Data on children Persons under the age of 16 should not transfer Personal Information to us unless they have the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s). We do not knowingly collect, nor do we want to receive, personal information about individuals who are under 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, please do not access our Service at any time or in any manner. We will take appropriate steps to delete the Personal Information of persons under the age of 13.</p>\n\n  <p>Your Rights to your Personal Information</p>\n\n  <p>You have certain rights in respect of the Personal Information that we hold about you, including:</p>\n\n  <p>the right to be informed of the ways in which we use your information, as we seek to do in this Privacy Policy;</p>\n  <p>the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes;</p>\n  <p>the right to request access to the information that we hold about you;</p>\n  <p>the right to request that we correct or rectify any information that we hold about you which is out of date or incorrect;</p>\n  <p>in certain circumstances, the right to ask us to stop processing information about you; and</p>\n  <p>the right to lodge a complaint about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/).</p>\n  <p>Some upcoming new rights…</p>\n\n  <p>From 25 May 2018, in accordance with new data protection laws which will be in force from that date, you will have certain additional rights in respect of the information that we hold about you, including:</p>\n\n  <p>in addition to your right to lodge a complaint about us to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/), you will also be able to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority in your country of work or residence;</p>\n  <p>the right to withdraw your consent for our use of your information in reliance of your consent, which you can do by contacting us using any of the details at the top of this Privacy Notice;</p>\n  <p>the right to object to our using your information on the basis of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground; and</p>\n  <p>the right to receive a copy of any information we hold about you (or request that we transfer this to another service provider) in a structured, commonly-used, machine readable format, in certain circumstances; and</p>\n  <p>the right to ask us to limit or cease processing or erase information we hold about you in certain circumstances.\n  </p><p>How to exercise your rights\n\n  </p><p>You may exercise your rights above by contacting us using the details at the top of this Privacy Policy, or in the case of preventing processing for marketing activities also by checking certain boxes on forms that we use to collect your data to tell us that you don’t want to be involved in marketing or by updating your marketing preferences via your account with us.</p>\n\n\n  <p>What we need from you to process your requests</p>\n\n  <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n\n  <p>You will need to have created an account in order for us to provide you with your information because without an account, we are not able to connect your data to a verifiable email address.\n\n  </p><p>From 25 May 2018, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number</p> of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<p></p>\n\n  <p>Changes to your Personal Information and unsubscribing from the Service</p>\n\n  <p>It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal Information changes during your use of the Service. You may change the Personal Information that Scribe retains about you by accessing the Service and following the instructions.</p>\n\n  <p>You may unsubscribe from the Service at any time.
